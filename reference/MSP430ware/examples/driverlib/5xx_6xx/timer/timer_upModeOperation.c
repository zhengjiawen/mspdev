//!  MSP430F543xA Demo - Timer_B, Toggle P1.0, CCR0 Up Mode ISR, DCO SMCLK
//!
//!  Description: Toggle P1.0 using software and TB_0 ISR. Timer_B is
//!  configured for up mode, thus the timer overflows when TBR counts
//!  to CCR0. In this example, CCR0 is loaded with 50000.
//!  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = TBCLK = default DCO ~1.045MHz
//!

//!
//! This example uses the following peripherals and I/O signals.  You must
//! review these and change as needed for your own board:
//! - Timer peripheral
//! - GPIO Port peripheral
//!
//! This example uses the following interrupt handlers.  To use this example
//! in your own application you must add these interrupt handlers to your
//! vector table.
//! - Timer B0
